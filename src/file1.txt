Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Users can contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity. The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.

Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting 1.5 billion unique visitors monthly as of March 2020.[1] It currently has more than 51 million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,043,369 articles in English with 135,392 active contributors in the past month. Every day, visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create hundreds of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia. (See the statistics page for more information.)

Anyone is allowed to add or edit words, references, images and other media here. What is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor. To remain, the content must be free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people. It must fit within Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a published reliable source. Editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research will not remain. Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to ensure that edits are improvements.
